Our team will respond to your report as soon as possible, acknowledging receipt and outlining the next steps in the process. We greatly appreciate your help in identifying and addressing security issues.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you do not disclose security-related issues publicly until we have had a chance to address them. Once the issue is resolved, we will work with you to publish a coordinated disclosure according to industry best practices.
