## Our Pledge

We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community for all. We welcome people of all backgrounds and identities. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants' behavior.


## Be Respectful

Respect each other's ideas, skills, and contributions. We are here to collaborate and learn from one another. Disagreements are okay, but respectful and constructive communication is essential.

## Be Inclusive

Our community welcomes people of all backgrounds. We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or exclusion based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, or any other forms of identity.

## Be Kind and Considerate

Treat others as you would like to be treated. Be mindful of your words and actions. Do not insult or put down other community members.

## Encourage Diversity

We encourage different perspectives and ideas. Diversity enriches our community. Be open to learning from others with different experiences.
